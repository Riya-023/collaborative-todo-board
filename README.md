2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   \`\`\`env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/collaborative-todo
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
   PORT=5000
   \`\`\`

4. Start the backend server:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`

### Frontend Setup

   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. Create a `.env` file (optional):
   \`\`\`env
   VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000
   \`\`\`

4. Start the frontend development server:
   \`\`\`bash

## üéØ Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Register**: Create a new account with username, email, and password
2. **Login**: Access your dashboard with your credentials
3. **Create Tasks**: Click "Add Task" to create new tasks with title, description, priority, and assignment
4. **Manage Tasks**: Drag and drop tasks between columns, edit details, or delete tasks
5. **Smart Assign**: Use the target icon (üéØ) to automatically assign tasks to the user with the fewest active tasks
6. **Monitor Activity**: View real-time activity feed showing all user actions

### Key Features Explained

#### Smart Assign Logic
The Smart Assign feature automatically assigns tasks to the user with the fewest number of active tasks (Todo + In Progress). This ensures balanced workload distribution across team members.

**Implementation:**
1. Counts active tasks for each user
2. Identifies user with minimum active tasks
3. Assigns the task to that user
4. Logs the action in the activity feed

#### Conflict Handling
When two users attempt to edit the same task simultaneously:
1. The system detects the conflict
2. Both users receive a conflict notification
3. Users can choose to:
   - Continue editing (may overwrite other changes)
   - Cancel their edit (let the other user continue)
4. The resolution is handled gracefully without data loss

#### Real-time Features
- **Live Updates**: All task changes appear instantly for all users
- **User Presence**: See when other users join or leave
- **Activity Stream**: Real-time activity feed with user actions
- **Conflict Notifications**: Immediate alerts for editing conflicts


## üì± Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive with breakpoints at:
- **Desktop**: 1024px and above
- **Tablet**: 768px to 1023px
- **Mobile**: Below 768px

Key responsive features:
- Collapsible navigation on mobile
- Stacked columns on smaller screens
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Optimized modal sizes

## üîí Security Features

- **Password Hashing**: bcryptjs with salt rounds
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based auth
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **CORS Protection**: Configured for specific origins
- **XSS Prevention**: Proper data sanitization
